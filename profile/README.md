# Bangkit Academy 2024 Batch 2 Capstone Project

**Team ID** : `C242-FA01`

## Overview

This project began with an awareness of our environment, particularly in large cities. The heavy reliance on personal vehicles, such as cars and motorcycles, poses a significant environmental problem, as it produces increasing pollution, worsens air quality, and accelerates global warming. Therefore, in this project, we aim to reduce the carbon footprint by tracking users' transportation habits and making the process more engaging through challenges divided into different levels.
